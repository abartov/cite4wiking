# Cite4wiki NG

This is a re-write of the Cite4wiki Firefox addon using Mozilla Jetpack.

Once it reaches feature parity with cite4wiki, I intend to add features such as:

* support for multiple wiki templates (e.g. for Wikipedia in other languages)
* support for citing books from book pages in [OPACs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_public_access_catalog)
* maintenance of the various payloads on [Meta](http://meta.wikimedia.org), to be updated by users
    * actual templates between <nowiki> tags.  Documentation, help, examples, screenshots all around.
* use of a script to grab latest payload definitions off Meta and generate fresh string-building code when packaging cite4wiki

# Code
For now, this lives on GitHub, here: https://github.com/abartov/cite4wiking

Eventually, I'd be happy to host it on WMF's git server.
